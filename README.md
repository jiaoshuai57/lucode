# As network technology advances rapidly, safeguarding the copyright of digital content grows ever more crucial. To address the issue of insufficient real-time performance in current digital watermarking algorithms, a blocks similarity-based digital watermarking technique has been proposed. Operating on the highly correlated elements found in the second row and first column of the L matrix in the neighboring parity blocks, the computation of pixel values is directly carried out under the spatial domain to embed and extract the watermark information. The proposed method brings several contributions, such as 1) the high similarity correlation between neighboring L matrix blocks obtained after LU decomposition of image blocks is found; 2) based on the high similarity correlation derivation of neighboring L matrix blocks, the fast mapping mechanism between L matrix coefficients and spatial-domain pixels is proposed and derived; 3) this proposed method has better robustness and real-time performance, owing to its combination of the advantages of frequency domain watermarking and spatial domain watermarking The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM of this method are above 40dB and 0.94, respectively, and the average running time reaches 0.2 seconds, which satisfies the demands for invisibility and robustness while meanwhile excelling in real-time performance.
